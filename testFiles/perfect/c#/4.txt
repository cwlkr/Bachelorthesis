/ / / A default implementation of the < see cref = " IClientDescription " / > interface . 
/ / / A strongly - typed resource class , for looking up localized strings , etc . 
/ / / All string equality checks , whether checking secrets or their hashes , 
/ / / An absolute URL ; or < c > null < / c > if none is registered . 
/ / / Checks whether the specified client secret is correct . 
/ / / Determines whether a callback URI included in a client ' s authorization request 
/ / / does not include an explicit callback URI . 
/ / / Gets a value indicating whether a non - empty secret is registered for this client . 
/ / / Gets or sets the callback to use when an individual authorization request 
/ / / Gets or sets the type of the client . 
/ / / Initializes a new instance of the < see cref = " ClientDescription " / > class 
/ / / is among those allowed callbacks for the registered client . 
/ / / Looks up a localized string similar to Failure looking up secret for client or token . . 
/ / / Looks up a localized string similar to Invalid resource owner password credential . . 
/ / / Looks up a localized string similar to No callback URI was available for this request . . 
/ / / Looks up a localized string similar to The access token & apos ; s private signing key must be set . . 
/ / / Looks up a localized string similar to The callback URL ( { 0 } ) is not allowed for this client . . 
/ / / Looks up a localized string similar to The client secret was incorrect . . 
/ / / Looks up a localized string similar to The requested access scope exceeds the grant scope . . 
/ / / Overrides the current thread ' s CurrentUICulture property for all 
/ / / resource lookups using this strongly typed resource class . 
/ / / Returns the cached ResourceManager instance used by this class . 
/ / / should be done using < see cref = " MessagingUtilities . EqualsConstantTime " / > to mitigate timing attacks .
/ / / The client ' s secret , if any . 
/ / / This method may be overridden to allow for several callbacks to match . 
/ / / to represent a confidential client ( one that has an authenticating secret . ) 
/ / / to represent a public client ( one that does not have an authenticating secret . )
